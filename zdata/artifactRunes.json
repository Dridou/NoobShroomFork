If you haven't reached level 20 yet, don't hesitate to level up all your runes to level 10. Just use the highest color runes available to boost your base stats significantly!</p><h3>Lv20 reached:</h3><p>What should you do next? Should you prioritize sets absolutely? Should you choose the highest color runes? Should you focus only on the sub-stats? Let's break it down together.</p><h4>Which rune is good for me ?</h4><p>Hereâ€™s how to decide if a rune is good for you, in this order of priority:</p><ol><li>Main stat (especially for rune slots 4 and 6)</li><li>Sub-stats</li><li>Set effect</li></ol><p>Yes, the set effect should only be prioritized in the very late game (level +130). Why? Because a single rune can have a greater effect than a set of 4 runes of the same type. So, you shouldn't restrict yourself to certain types of runes until you have a significant selection. See the example below.</p><p>This rune has nearly 10% of Global Combo Dmg, which is the 4 set bonus of the combo set. Not event talking about the other present substats.</p><div class=text-center><img alt=\"Excellent rune example\"class=\"align-content-center img img-fluid img-padding rounded\"src=\/images\/rune-excellent-example.png><\/div><h4>Which stats are good for me ?</h4><p>Indeed, check your class guide to see which stats you need for slots 4 and 6. Generally:</p><ul><li><b>Archer<\/b>: Combo Damage \/ Crit Damage<li><b>Tank<\/b>: Counter Damage \/ Crit Damage (Berserk) or Crit Resistance (Martial Saint)<li><b>Mage<\/b>: Skill Damage \/ Crit Resistance<\/ul><h4>Global tips<\/h4><p>Next, also consider the sub-stats to prioritize and the recommended sets. You want sub-stats that are as rare (blue) as possible at level 1 and as many relevant sub-stats as possible.<p>However, do not underestimate runes with few or only one interesting sub-stat. If this sub-stat procs 5 times (at levels 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20) and you get 8% stun for a mage, it might be worth having some mediocre stats on the side...<p>Remember that leveling a rune to level 8 does not waste any experience if it is used as food later, and at level 12, you will only lose a little experience (equivalent to one whole level). Therefore, I recommend leveling all potentially interesting runes to level 8, and if they don't proc well, use them as food for another rune. Continue testing your runes this way.</p>",
