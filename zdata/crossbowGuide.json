Then you'll be able to choose the one to retain:<br><img alt=\"Fusion of two tier 2 red soul into a pink soul\"class=img-fluid src=/images/soul-fusion-result.png width=33%></ul><h3>Pink soul acquisition order</h3><p>The 'default' way and the most ballanced one is: ATK > COMBO > HP > DEF > BASIC ATK<p>Note that you can take Combo first if you priorize PvE content to get more rewards.<br>You can also take DEF before HP if you lack def more then hp.<h3>Souls levels ratio</h3><p>For the soul levels, and assuming you have every rune in red rarity (else it priorize your red offensive souls), here is a good ballanced example:<ul><li><span style=font-weight:700>lv20</span> | <span>Combo Dmg</span><li><span style=font-weight:700>lv20</span> | <span>Crit Dmg</span><li><span style=font-weight:700>lv20</span> | <span>Atk</span><li><span style=font-weight:700>lv15</span> | <span>HP</span><li><span style=font-weight:700>lv15</span> | <span>DEF</span><li><span style=font-weight:700>lv12</span> | <span>Res Crit Damage</span><li><span style=font-weight:700>lv15</span> | <span>Basic atk</span><li><span style=font-weight:700>lv1 </span>| <span>Counter Dmg</span></ul><br><p>Since it is posible to reset souls, It is advised to take 1/2 days per week where you only level up your atk/critDmg/ComboDmg souls and try to push the PvE content as much as posible, then reverting to a ballanced set.<p>I don't think there is, for now, a perfect strategy for souls level up and I also encourage you to test by yourself!",
