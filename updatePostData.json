		'<h3>Usage tips</h3><p>Several essential facts to know concerning souls:<ul><li>Salvage any soul below a red one will destroy it permanently and refund you the entiere xp amount spent on it.<li>You cannot salvage a red one, though you can reset its level with the <img alt="Soul reset icon"class=img-fluid src=/images/reset_icon.png style=width:1.5rem> on top of it for 500<img alt="Red diamond"class=img-fluid src=/images/red_diamond.png style=width:1.75rem><li>All the extra red runes you have will be used to reroll the bonus stat of your pink rune. Then you\'ll be able to choose the one to retain:<br><img alt="Fusion of two tier 2 red soul into a pink soul"class=img-fluid src=/images/soul_fusion_result.png width=33%></ul><h3>Pink soul acquisition order</h3><p>The \'default\' way and the most ballanced one is: ATK > COMBO > HP > DEF > BASIC ATK<p>Note that you can take Combo first if you priorize PvE content to get more rewards.<br>You can also take DEF before HP if you lack def more then hp.<h3>Souls levels ratio</h3><p>For the soul levels, and assuming you have every rune in red rarity (else it priorize your red offensive souls), here is a good ballanced example:<ul><li><span style=font-weight:700>lv20</span> | <span>Combo Dmg</span><li><span style=font-weight:700>lv20</span> | <span>Crit Dmg</span><li><span style=font-weight:700>lv20</span> | <span>Atk</span><li><span style=font-weight:700>lv15</span> | <span>HP</span><li><span style=font-weight:700>lv15</span> | <span>DEF</span><li><span style=font-weight:700>lv12</span> | <span>Res Crit Damage</span><li><span style=font-weight:700>lv15</span> | <span>Basic atk</span><li><span style=font-weight:700>lv1 </span>| <span>Counter Dmg</span></ul><br><p>Since it is posible to reset souls, It is advised to take 1/2 days per week where you only level up your atk/critDmg/ComboDmg souls and try to push the PvE content as much as posible, then reverting to a ballanced set.<p>I don\'t think there is, for now, a perfect strategy for souls level up and I also encourage you to test by yourself!',

The effectiveness of mounts, artifacts, back accessories, and avian pets varies based on the activity. For example, some mounts, like the Ox, are excellent in PvP but only average in PvE. The same applies to artifacts and back accessories. Even avian pets\' usefulness depends on the activity. For more precise information and details, please refer to the recommended sets section.',
